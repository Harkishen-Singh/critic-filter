# critic-filter

Content have become _hateful and much distracting_. With increase day, we see more hatred online than ever. This maybe from social media sites,
articles, religious and cultural content, or a personal blog, criticism is seen at different levels. Often, things cross limits and leads to
**physical and psychological damages**.

Critic-filter takes a step into this problem. Critic-filter is a **chrome extension** that block/blurs/cleans the content you are viewing from
distractive or hateful content in general and specific. Contents that are disturbing or violent are subjective to each one of us. Critic-filter
allowed to _maintain your list_ of **bad** words and blocks/hides such content in real-world whenever you comes across it. Now, you can browse
the web without any worries.

**Note:** _Critic-filter is a free project which is in active development. It is planned to will be released to chrome store when ready.
Similar portability for other browser platforms will be consider at a later stage._
